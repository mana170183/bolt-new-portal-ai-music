# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## 🔧 Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Vercel was trying to build a Next.js app but found a React/Vite project  
**Solution**: Updated configuration for React/Vite deployment

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed from `@vercel/next` to `@vercel/static-build`
- Set output directory to `dist` (Vite default)
- Configured SPA routing

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Changed build scripts to use Vite instead of Next.js
- Removed Next.js specific dependencies
- Set `vite build` as the main build command

## 🚀 Deploy Steps for webappdev1701

### Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: `bolt-new-portal-ai-music`
3. Go to Settings → Git
4. Change **Production Branch** from `main` to `stage`
5. Click "Deploy" or trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Deploy from Command Line
```bash
# Make sure you're on the stage branch
git checkout stage

# Pull latest changes (if working from GitHub)
git pull origin stage

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# When prompted, select:
# - Build Command: npm run build  
# - Output Directory: dist
# - Install Command: npm install
```

### Option 3: Push Changes to Trigger Auto-Deploy
```bash
# If you have auto-deploy enabled, just push:
git push origin stage
```

## 🔧 Vercel Project Settings

Make sure these settings are correct in your Vercel dashboard:

### Build & Development Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Other (or Vite)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Development Command**: `npm run dev`

### Environment Variables (set these in Vercel dashboard)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## 🎯 Expected Build Process

After the fix, Vercel should:
1. ✅ Detect React/Vite project correctly
2. ✅ Run `npm install` 
3. ✅ Run `npm run build` (which runs `vite build`)
4. ✅ Output to `dist/` directory
5. ✅ Deploy as static site with SPA routing

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After successful deployment:
```bash
# Test your deployed frontend
curl https://your-app.vercel.app

# Should return your React app's HTML
```

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

1. **Clear Vercel Cache**:
   - In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Functions
   - Click "Clear All Cache"

2. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Look for any dependency or build errors
   - Ensure all environment variables are set

3. **Local Test**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ls dist/  # Should contain index.html and assets
   ```

The configuration is now correctly set for React/Vite deployment! 🎉
