Total Savings: $397/month (59% reduction)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Cost Reduction (Week 1)
1. Downgrade Redis to Standard C1
2. Downgrade SQL Database to Standard S0
3. Switch Storage to LRS
4. Reduce AI service quotas

### Phase 2: Advanced Optimization (Week 2)
1. Implement auto-shutdown for non-business hours
2. Set up cost alerts and budgets
3. Optimize container resource allocations
4. Implement data lifecycle policies

### Phase 3: Scaling Preparation (Week 3)
1. Create scaling automation scripts
2. Document scale-up procedures
3. Set up monitoring for scaling triggers
4. Test rapid scaling scenarios

## Auto-Shutdown Strategy for Development

### Business Hours Configuration
```yaml
Auto-Shutdown Schedule:
  Weekdays: 6 PM - 8 AM (14 hours down)
  Weekends: Friday 6 PM - Monday 8 AM (62 hours down)
  
Potential Additional Savings: 60-70% of compute costs
  Container Apps: Additional $25/month savings
  SQL Database: Pause-capable in vCore model
  Redis: Cannot pause, but reduced usage
```

### Implementation with Azure Automation
```powershell
# Auto-shutdown runbook
# Saves additional ~$35/month on compute resources
```

## Scale-Up Strategy for Production Readiness

### Quick Scale-Up Checklist
```yaml
Database Scaling (5 minutes):
  Basic → General Purpose GP_Gen5_4
  Cost increase: $5 → $350/month

Redis Scaling (2 minutes):
  Standard C1 → Premium P2
  Cost increase: $73 → $962/month

Container Apps (Automatic):
  Auto-scaling will handle demand
  Cost increases proportionally

AI Services (10 minutes):
  Increase TPM quotas via Azure portal
  Cost increases based on usage
```

## Cost Monitoring and Alerts

### Budget Configuration
```yaml
Development Budget Alerts:
  Monthly Budget: $300
  Alert Thresholds:
    - 50% ($150): Email notification
    - 80% ($240): Email + SMS
    - 100% ($300): All alerts + auto-scale down

Weekly Budget: $75
Daily Budget: $10
```

### Cost Anomaly Detection
```yaml
Anomaly Thresholds:
  Daily spending > 150% of average
  Resource usage spikes > 200%
  Unexpected resource creation
  Failed to shutdown after hours
```

## Resource-Specific Optimizations

### Container Apps
```yaml
Development Configuration:
  CPU: 0.25 vCPU (vs 0.5 current)
  Memory: 512Mi (vs 2Gi current)
  Min Replicas: 0 (vs 1 current) - for auto-shutdown
  Max Replicas: 2 (vs 3 current)
  
Additional Savings: $20/month
```

### Monitoring & Logging
```yaml
Log Retention Optimization:
  Application Insights: 30 days (vs 90 days)
  Log Analytics: 30 days (vs 90 days)
  Metrics: 7 days (vs 30 days)
  
Additional Savings: $15/month
```

### Network Optimization
```yaml
Development Network:
  Disable private endpoints (not needed for dev)
  Use basic load balancer
  Minimal VNet configuration
  
Additional Savings: $10/month
```

## Final Optimized Cost: $185/month

```yaml
Ultra-Optimized Development Environment:
  Container Apps (optimized): $25/month
  SQL Database (Basic): $5/month
  Storage Account (LRS): $25/month
  Redis Cache (Basic C0): $16/month
  Key Vault: $3/month
  Container Registry (Basic): $17/month
  AI Services (minimal): $50/month
  Azure AD B2C: $5/month
  Monitoring (reduced): $10/month
  Network (basic): $2/month
  Auto-shutdown savings: -$35/month

Total: $185/month
Total Savings: $490/month (73% reduction)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Implementation**: Apply the Terraform configuration changes
2. **Testing**: Validate that reduced resources meet development needs
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement cost alerts and anomaly detection
4. **Documentation**: Update scaling procedures for production deployment
5. **Review Cycle**: Monthly cost review and optimization opportunities

This optimization maintains full functionality for development while providing massive cost savings and clear paths to scale up for staging and production environments.
