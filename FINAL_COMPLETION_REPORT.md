- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **Features**:
  - Health check endpoint (`/health`)
  - Genres metadata (`/api/genres`) - 33 genres available
  - Moods metadata (`/api/moods`) - 26 moods available
  - Simple generation (`/api/generate`)
  - Advanced generation (`/api/advanced-generate`)
  - File download (`/api/download/<filename>`)
  - Real WAV audio file generation
  - Enhanced multi-instrumental synthesis
  - Metadata integration with detailed track information

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
- **Location**: `/src/`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational
- **URL**: http://localhost:3002
- **Components**:
  - `App.jsx` - Main application with mode switching
  - `MusicGenerator.jsx` - Simple mode interface
  - `AdvancedMusicGenerator.jsx` - Advanced studio interface
- **Features**:
  - Responsive, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
  - Real-time genre/mood fetching from backend
  - Advanced controls (instruments, tempo, key, complexity)
  - Audio playback and download functionality
  - Error handling and success notifications
